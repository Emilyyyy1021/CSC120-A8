Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
    It is a game class. The user will be acting as a player and they will have a profile, setting their height. The user can pick up anything they want, and they might loose their health points or height. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
    I add a method to figure out if there the item is in the inverntory or not. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Because this is a highly free homework, I just try to make everything simple. The interphase definitly worked. I still need to work on it, for it to actually become a game which can interact with the user.
